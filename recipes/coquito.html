    <p><strong>What Is Coquito?</strong></p>
    Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."
    <h4>Coquito Ingredients</h4>
    These are the ingredients you'll need to make a decadent batch of coquito:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Evaporated milk:</strong>This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream of coconut:</strong>Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk:</strong>Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li><strong>White rum:</strong>The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li><strong>Water: </strong>Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>

    </ul>
